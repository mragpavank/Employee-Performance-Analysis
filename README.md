# Employee-Performance-Analysis
The goals of our project are to establish key learnings relating to employee performances of INX Future Inc. Various capabilities of Machine Learning have been used to analyze the data and find the core underlying causes of employee performance. The findings of this project will help identify factors which affect performance ratings, support right course of actions to address under-performance and present recommendations to improve hiring efficiencies to INX Future Inc.  The dataset provided was of very good quality and required minimal cleansing work before proceeding to data exploration. One of the challenges faced was that categorical variables were high and it was required to convert them into numerical values thereby, initially increasing the complexity.
